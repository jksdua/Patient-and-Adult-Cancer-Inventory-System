That's ok.  This is my first time using github or any other version control system as well.  We can learn together.  So, why do we need to use github?  Well, let's take the example of our last lab.  We all worked on some Java code but Alex needs to e-mail it to us for us to get the code.  This way we can simply *pull* it ourselves.

Another benefit is that we can all work on different parts of the code and simply merge our changes later.
